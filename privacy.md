## App Logs

App logs are kept locally on your device until you actively send them to us.

Your logs will be transmitted if you use the **Send Logs** functionality from within Nextcloud Yaga. Please note that the **Send Logs** functionality requires you to specify who receives them. This way, you can inspect the logs before sending them to us.

We advise the following best practices regarding your logs:
* Inspect your logs before sending them.
* Never publish your logs on open forums, i.e., Github issues.
* Send your logs only to the developer directly: <vauvenal5@gmail.com>

## Nextcloud

Nextcloud Yaga only allows you to connect to an existing Nextcloud instance. We do not take any responsibility for security or privacy policies applied to that Nextcloud instance or Nextcloud itself.
